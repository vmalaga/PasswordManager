Password manager aims to be a simple but efective password database, but not
a sharing password application, only for a reduced number of sysadmin or developers.

My work as sysadmin, require to save a lot of passwords for installed applications
from 100 to more of 1000. Since today i was using the tool named gallinero, from that
Password Manager is based

Now I have the challenge of migrating this application to django, plus add some functionality
like send the required password the any email address

FEATURES:

 * Search for metadata
 * Password is only viewed if you click on the password field, if not, it is hidden
 * passwords are encripted on the database based on django.core.signing
 * filters on right size django bar

TODO:
 * send emails with new window and a django template
 * change passwords textbox to password box
 * installation instructions
 
REQUIREMENTS:
 * Django 1.4
